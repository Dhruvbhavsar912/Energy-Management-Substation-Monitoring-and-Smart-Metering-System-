# Energy-Management-Substation-Monitoring-and-Smart-Metering-System


# Introduction
Energy Management, Sub Station Monitoring and Smart Metering is a critical field to increase efficiency and reduce energy losses. Energy management systems include sensors, meters, controls, applications and analytics tools which enable users, households, businesses, governments, to monitor, manage and control processes, assets and resources in the supply chain. 
This project is an IOT based project where user can monitor and control the energy meter using a mobile app (Android & IOS) using Flutter.   
The given below are the block diagram of project architecture, distribution and their various parameters.

The above screenshots shows the login page and credentials given as an input by the user after registering in the app also the authentication and security is done with the help of Google firebase. After this the user will navigate to the home page which is divided into 2 parts Substation to Transformer and Transformer to Home & Industry.

As we have seen earlier the account we are using in the second screenshot is dhruvbhavsar912@gmail.com and we can see all the details of the app having same email at the backend in the firebase which has value similar to that of an app also there is real time change if there is any change in any parameters like temperature, condition, voltage, current, etc. Also user can control the circuit breaker with the help of a toggle button available in app.
